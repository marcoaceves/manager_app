This app was created for AHF Pharmacy. The application allows the Pharmacy Manager to assign tasks and deadlines for those tasks. The Application has many features including Add New Users, creating new tasks, creating new stations, assigning tasks to stations, delete users. Users can have admin privileges that allow them to access all areas of the program. Users with Staff privileges only have access to their own profile where they can see what tasks they need to work on. When a task is complete the user can check off the task and update the status of the task. The user can also add a comment to the task.
